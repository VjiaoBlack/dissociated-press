Four score and seven years ago our poor power to add or any nation might live. It is altogether fitting and that from these honored dead we can not have consecrated it, far above our poor power to the living, rather, to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long endure. We have died in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, conceived and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on a final resting place for the people, by the people, for the people, by the people, for those who struggled here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for those who struggled here, have a new nation, conceived in a great task remaining before us the unfinished work which they who fought here gave the living, rather, to be here dedicated to the unfinished work which they did here. It is altogether fitting and that cause for us the last full measure of that these dead shall have died in a final resting place for which they who here highly resolve that nation might live. It is for us to the earth.
